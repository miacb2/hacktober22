    <h2>Letter Combinations of a Phone Number(Leet Code)</h2>
    <p> Python3 </p>
    <p>This code wants you to to take a string using the digits 2-9 and each of these digits have a few letters assigned to them like a phone and when these numbers are 
    put in the code will return all possible string combinations and there could be. This problem was solved using a key and for loops allowing all possible combinations of the letters.
